What a change is here!\\nIs Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\\nSo soon forsaken?

Pronounce this sentence then,\\nWomen may fall, when there’s no strength in men.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAnd bad’st me bury love.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nNot in a grave\\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI pray thee chide me not, her I love now\\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\\nThe other did not so.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nO, she knew well\\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\\nBut come young waverer, come go with me,\\nIn one respect I’ll thy assistant be;\\nFor this alliance may so happy prove,\\nTo turn your households’ rancour to pure love.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
